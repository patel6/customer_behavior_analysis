## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL, and Tableau to uncover insights that can support business decision-making.

The workflow covers the full analytics pipeline: data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based querying, and dashboard development.

The goal was to transform raw transactional data into clear, actionable insights through structured analysis and visualization.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading (Python)

* Imported dataset into Jupyter Notebook
* Inspected structure, column types, and summary statistics
* Identified missing values and inconsistencies

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed distributions of numerical features
* Examined categorical variables and customer segments
* Identified trends in sales, spending, and purchase behavior
* Created visualizations to highlight key patterns

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values
* Removed duplicates
* Standardized column formats
* Corrected data types for analysis

### 4. SQL Analysis (MySQL Workbench)

* Imported cleaned dataset into MySQL
* Wrote SQL queries to extract business insights
* Performed aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
* Used GROUP BY, JOIN, and filtering techniques
* Answered business-focused questions such as:

  * Which categories generate the highest revenue?
  * What is the average spending per customer?
  * Which customer segments contribute most to sales?

### 5. Tableau Dashboard

* Connected Tableau to processed data
* Built an interactive dashboard showing:

  * Revenue trends
  * Category performance
  * Customer segmentation
  * Key KPIs
* Designed visuals to be clear and decision-focused
